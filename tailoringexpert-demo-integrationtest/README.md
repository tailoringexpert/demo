Integrationtest to test demo implementations used by the plattform.

## Test configuration

For user/system dependend variables the [dotenv-java](https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java) library is used.
Copy file _.env.example_ to _.env_ and adapt setting to your local system. An automated build environment shall use
default values, which have to be defined in test classes if needed.
