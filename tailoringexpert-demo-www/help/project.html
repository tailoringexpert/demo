<h2>Import requirement selection</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes there's an existing reference tailoring that's similar to the one a user is working on. The easiest way to
    transfer the reference tailoring is to create documents in the reference tailoring. In contains an Excel file with
    all requirements and their current status. This can be imported into the dialogue. This is possible because it is
    assumed that catalogues are backward compatible. This means that deleted requirements are not deleted in the
    document, but the text is changed to deleted.

<p>This icon opens a dialogue box containing all the notes created for the tailoring. This includes the comments made
    during the catalogue selection step. It is worth mentioning that notes cannot be deleted.
