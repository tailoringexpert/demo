<p>This is page provides an overview of all projects created so far.
    An already created project can be
<ul>
    <li>edited by clicking the pencil icon,</li>
    <li>copied to a new project with a new screeningsheet by clicking the copy icon or</li>
    <li>deleted by clicked the trash icon</li>
</ul>
It is also possible to create new projects by using the <code>New Project</code> button.
</p>

<p>
    When a project is copied, the same catalogue is used as in the project being copied. This means that an already
    outdated catalogue version will be used!
</p>

<p>
    Instead of copying an existing project, it is advisable to create the tailoring Excel file of the existing project
    and create a new project with the catalogue version as required. Once the initial tailoring has been created, the
    previously exported Excel can be used as an input source for the tailoring.
