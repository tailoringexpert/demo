<p>
    This is the wizzard to create a new project. Wizzard is performed in four steps:
<ol>
    <li>select catalog version</li>
    <li>upload a screeningsheet</li>
    <li>check calculated selection vector based on screeningsheet input and update vector if needed</li>
    <li>create project</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Select catalog version</h2>
<p>This is the first step in creating a new project. If only one catalogue is valid at the time of creation, it will be
    selected. Any notes entered will be added to the initial tailoring created for the project. They are not mandatory.
</p>

<h2>Upload a screeningsheet</h2>
<p>
    A screening sheet is required as input for project creation and tailoring. Format and content are tenant-specific.
    Once uploaded, extracted values are displayed.
</p>

<h2>Check calculated selection vector</h2>
<p>
    A selection vector is calculated based on the given screen sheet. A selection vector defines levels for all
    parameters of a tailoring. These values are used to select requirements for the initial tailoring.
    The values can be either modified by
<ul>
    <li>selecting a profile</li>
    <li>adjusting the values by clicking on them</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Create project</h2>
<p>
    By clicking the Create button, the project is created with an initial tailoring using the defined selection vector.
    for the (pre-)selection of requirements.
