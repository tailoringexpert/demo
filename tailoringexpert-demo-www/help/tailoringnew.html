</header>

<p>
    This is the wizzard to create a new tailoring. Wizzard is performed in four steps:
<ol>
    <li>select catalog version</li>
    <li>upload a screeningsheet</li>
    <li>check calculated selection vector based on screeningsheet input and update vector if needed</li>
    <li>create tailoring</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Upload a screeningsheet</h2>
<p>
    A screening sheet is required as input for project creation and tailoring. Format and content are tenant-specific.
    Once uploaded, extracted values are displayed.
</p>

<h2>Check calculated selection vector</h2>
<p>
    A selection vector is calculated based on the given screen sheet. A selection vector defines levels for all
    parameters of a tailoring. These values are used to select requirements for the initial tailoring.
    The values can be either modified by
<ul>
    <li>selecting a profile</li>
    <li>adjusting the values by clicking on them</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Create tailoring</h2>
<p>
    By clicking the Create button, the tailoring is created using the defined selection vector.
    for the (pre-)selection of requirements.
