</header>

<p>
    This is the wizzard to create a new tailoring. Wizzard is performed in four steps:
<ol>
    <li>select catalog version</li>
    <li>upload a screeningsheet</li>
    <li>check calculated selection vector based on screeningsheet input and update vector if needed</li>
    <li>create tailoring</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Upload a screeningsheet</h2>
<p>
    A screening sheet is required as input for project creation and tailoring. Format and content are tenant-specific.
    Once uploaded, extracted values are displayed.
</p>

<h2>Check calculated selection vector</h2>
<p>
    A selection vector is calculated based on the given screen sheet. A selection vector defines levels for all
    parameters of a tailoring. These values are used to select requirements for the initial tailoring.
    The values can be either modified by
<ul>
    <li>selecting a profile</li>
    <li>adjusting the values by clicking on them</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Predefined Profiles</h3>
<h4>Pragmatic LEO Mission</h4>
<p>
    These are mainly earth observation missions, which allow for pragmatic approaches, e.g. NewSpace or COTs
    application. Examples for such missions are TerraSar, Tandem X or EnMap.
</p>

<h4>Operational LEO Mission</h4>
<p>
    These are mainly earth observation missions, which do not allow for pragmatic approaches since they are requiring
    operational results and availability. Examples for such missions are the Copernicus-Sentinel Satellites.
</p>

<h4>Platform Equipment</h4>
<p>
    This is equipment, which will be flying on a satellite platform for either an experiment, payload or the platform
    service. Examples for such equipment are the standard equipment from suppliers like TESAT or any experiment/payload
    equipment.
</p>

<h4>Telecom</h4>
<p>
    These are telecommunication satellites. Examples for such missions are the EDRS-Satellites.</p>

<h4>ISS-Experiment außen</h4>
<p>
    These are payloads or experiments that will be placed on any outside platform of the ISS. The dedicated platform
    provider is to be distinguished in the screening-sheet and tailoring of requirements.
</p>


<h4>ISS-Experiment intern</h4>
<p>
    These are payloads or experiments or service equipment (e.g. on life support) that will be placed inside of the ISS.
    The dedicated module in which the experiment will be conducted is to be distinguished in the screening-sheet and
    tailoring of requirements.
</p>

<h4>Bodenaktivitäten</h4>
<p>
    This coves all ground based activities, from ground experiments to facilities supporting operation or testing.
</p>

<h4>"Studentenmission" (Nano/Micro-Mission) &amp; Technologiedemonstration</h4>
<p>
    These are mainly CubeSat or Small Sat activities, which are part of student education or technology demonstration.
</p>

<h4>Deep Space Science Mission / Instrument oder Lander</h4>
<p>
    These are all missions, which are supposed to explore e.g. the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Planetary Moons or
    scientific mission to Lagrange points respectively deep space. This missions can be full missions, Lander modules or
    experiments/instrument payloads on these.
</p>


<h2>Create tailoring</h2>
<p>
    By clicking the Create button, the tailoring is created using the defined selection vector.
    for the (pre-)selection of requirements.
